# Appearance

Making VS Code appearance like Sublime Text.<br>
Diving the editor into two columns & spliting the right  column into half.<br>
Upper half is for input, lower half is for output. 

Theme: Learn With Sumit.

# Environment
No need to create a build system for this. Just add  the following lines:
```cpp
#ifndef ONLINE_JUDGE
    freopen("input.txt", "r", stdin);
    freopen("output.txt", "w", stdout);
#endif
```
We can also skip creating build system in Sublime Text by using this lines and selecting 'c++ single file' build system.

To run in Vs Code: `Ctrl + Alt + N`
